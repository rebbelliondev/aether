# aetherOS

Welcome to the aether project! This project is an operating system, designed by @rebbelliondev and @Toni-Graphics. Right now, we are just starting, and you can expect changes to this code. 

At this moment, we are working on Memory. For specifically what we are working on in memory, see this link: [[Paging] (https://osdev.miraheze.org/wiki/Paging)]
